      You will be shown a number of cards. Each card you click on will
      reveal an adorable picture of Jay. You need to find the other card with the matching picture of Jay.<br><br>
      For every pair of cards you click on that is a match, you add
      1
      pebble of food to Jay's dinner. For every pair that is not a match, you take away 1 pebble from his
      dinner.<br><br>
      Your
      goal is to make sure Jay has enough to eat to make it through the night.</p>
